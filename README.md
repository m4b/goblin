### Documentation

https://docs.rs/goblin/

[changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

### Usage

Goblin requires `rustc` 1.56.0 (Rust 2021 edition).

Add to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
goblin = "0.5"
```

### Features

* awesome crate name
* zero-copy, cross-platform, endian-aware, ELF64/32 implementation - wow!
* zero-copy, cross-platform, endian-aware, 32/64 bit Mach-o parser - zoiks!
* PE 32/64-bit parser - bing!
* a Unix _and_ BSD style archive parser (latter courtesy of [@willglynn]) - huzzah!
* many cfg options - it will make your head spin, and make you angry when reading the source!
* fuzzed - "I am happy to report that goblin withstood 100 million fuzzing runs, 1 million runs
  each for seed 1\~100." - [@sanxiyn]
* tests

`libgoblin` aims to be your one-stop shop for binary parsing, loading, and analysis.

### Use-cases

Goblin primarily supports the following important use cases:

1. Core, std-free `#[repr(C)]` structs, tiny compile time, 32/64 (or both) at your leisure.

1. Type punning. Define a function once on a type, but have it work on 32 or 64-bit variants -
   without really changing anything, and no macros! See `examples/automagic.rs` for a basic example.

1. `std` mode. This throws in read and write impls via `Pread` and `Pwrite`, reading from file,
   convenience allocations, extra methods, etc. This is for clients who can allocate and want to
   read binaries off disk.

1. `Endian_fd`. A truly terrible name :laughing: this is for binary analysis like in [panopticon]
   or [falcon] which needs to read binaries of foreign endianness, _or_ as a basis for
   constructing cross platform foreign architecture binutils, e.g. [cargo-sym] and [bingrep] are
   simple examples of this, but the sky is the limit.

Here are some things you could do with this crate (or help to implement so they could be done):

1. Write a compiler and use it to [generate binaries][faerie] (all the raw C structs have
   [`Pwrite`][scroll] derived).
1. Write a binary analysis tool which loads, parses, and analyzes various binary formats, e.g.,
   [panopticon] or [falcon].
1. Write a [semi-functioning dynamic linker][dryad].
1. Write a [kernel][redox-os] and load binaries using `no_std` cfg. I.e., it is essentially just
   struct and const defs (like a C header) - no fd, no output, no std.
1. Write a [bin2json] tool, because why shouldn't binary formats be in JSON?

### Cfgs

`libgoblin` is designed to be massively configurable. The current flags are:

* elf64 - 64-bit elf binaries, `repr(C)` struct defs
* elf32 - 32-bit elf binaries, `repr(C)` struct defs
* mach64 - 64-bit mach-o `repr(C)` struct defs
* mach32 - 32-bit mach-o `repr(C)` struct defs
* pe32 - 32-bit PE `repr(C)` struct defs
* pe64 - 64-bit PE `repr(C)` struct defs
* archive - a Unix Archive parser
* endian_fd - parses according to the endianness in the binary
* std - to allow `no_std` environments

## Contributing

1. Please prefix commits with the affected binary component; the more specific the better, e.g.,
   if you only modify relocations in the elf module, then do "elf.reloc: added new constants for Z80"
1. Commit messages must explain their change, no generic "changed", or "fix"; if you push commits
   like this on a PR, be aware [@m4b] or someone will most likely squash them.
1. If you are making a large change to a module, please raise an issue first and lets discuss;
   I don't want to waste your time if its not a good technical direction, or etc.
1. If your PR is not getting attention, please respond to all relevant comments raised on the PR,
   and if still no response, ping [@m4b], [@philipc], or [@willglynn] in github and also feel free
   to email [@m4b].
1. Please add tests if you are adding a new feature. Feel free to add tests even if you are not,
   tests are awesome and easy in rust.
1. Once cargo format is officially released, please format your _patch_ using the default settings.
